[San Francisco Groove]({{site.baseurl}}/about/) is beginning tryouts for the 2015 season. We're a highly competitive mixed team based in the Bay Area that has had solid seasons the last two years, just on the verge of breaking through to the elite level.
 
Intent on making that a reality this season, we'll be holding tryouts across the bay. We're looking for players who are hungry every time they step on the field, but who are also super fun and always spirited. Playing great ultimate and winning is important, but treating each other with love and respect is paramount. Luckily for us all, none of these are mutually exclusive. Groove is always working to be a great model of the hard-working, spirited ultimate we all love.
 
 
Here's a look at our early [schedule]({{site.baseurl}}/2015-calendar/):
 
- **Open Tryouts**: April 18 at Baylands Park in Sunnyvale, 9 a.m. â€“ 1 p.m.
- **Closed Tryouts**: April 25, location and time TBD
- **Potential Future Tryouts**: TBD
 
If you're interested, please fill out this [quick survey](http://goo.gl/forms/2LxkBshZdv) and let us know who you are and what you're looking for this season.
