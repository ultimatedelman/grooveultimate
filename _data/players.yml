  bio: 			  Sam is a nonstop engine on offense that finds ways to get open whenever you need her to be. Her play has very few flaws that some experts argue she is a robot but it's heavily disputed because she digs too much groove in her game to be made of wires and metal. Others believe she is the descendant of flying squirrels because of her ability to layout.

She's been on the run ever since, basically never stopping, strangely drawn to hovering plastic and its utter annihilation. When not sending opponents fleeing in face-melting terror or absorbing the surrounding power of the universe, she enjoys fixing people's bodies, cycling, and climbing."

              Nikki. 

              That's right, Nikki. If you spell it "Nicky" she will hunt you down. In a list of Johnsons, this girl stands out. After being voted "Best Eyes" (by people who have eyes) Nikki learned to look at the world a little differently. She does not see her offense, she sees weakness in defenders and the place where her cutters will be. She handles with the best of 'em and can get you out of your stall 9 jam. Her first book, "Shredding defenses: Yellow 3/4 length tights and other secrets of the game" is slated for release this season.

              Nikki wants to live in a world filled with stars, smiles, and free glute massages. Barring that, she'd settle for a hug and tickets to a Celtics game. 

              When she’s not throwing the spiciest inside-out flick in the Southwest region, you can find her posting up, calling for the rock, and workin' on her J.

He's been called the fastest man in ultimate, which is hard to confirm because he leaves defenders too breathless to speak. What is confirmed is that Adam is a great teammate: his sideline support makes cheerleaders look unenthusiastic and his jokes are always good for a laugh (or a groan). And watch out... his fever is contagious!"

              Meet one of our newest groovy additions: our adorbs babyfaced pun-wielding O-Bro, Kyle aka Ky~e (pronounced something like Kyrrrrrr, with slightly nasal overtone). After migrating from a college-land far far away named Duke, and more recently from Yosemite rangering, Ky~e wasted no time impressing all with his zippy cuts, ear-to-ear-grinning full field hucks, and did I mention those big blue eyes? 
    
              First he (bow)wowed us on SFWL's Dog(e)patch, and then served up such delectable Deep Dish at Lei Out that we simply couldn't resist. After a brief tug-of-war with the Molar Hairs (names have been changed to protect privacy) during tryouts, Groove emerged victorious and luckily was able to claim Kyle an officially *Groovy Dude 2014* (TM). Also luckily his grooviness came naturally. 
              
              From bestowing nickname gems like Puddles to scaling walls of breweries, to hosting World Cup viewings at his casa, to ensuring the Groove-Me is ever-replete with puns, Ky~e fit right in. Now he's off exploring Norwegian woods, and our fingers are crossed that he doesn't get scooped up by some Scandinavian goddess-model (though for his sake this would admittedly be amazing) and instead returns for Groove 2015.

              Brooke Ray Smith (B-Ray) goes hard at life. She is an absolute baller who truly shines in boosting the game of ultimate and the happiness of people around her. We've seen her handle with the best of them on the misty fields of Winter League and the endless sands of Santa Monica, but she is right at home as an alpha O-Line cutter. She is unstoppable when she's in the Groove, and trust me, she is always in the Groove. In a response to a question on the success of America's healthcare system, President Barack (B-Rock) Obama declared, "I'm sorry, what was that? I was busy watching B-Ray make a sick grab while laying out sideways." 

              In a tribute which does not even come close to capturing her awesomeness, a poetic tribute:
              
              B-Ray, we'll always B-Rayteful for your loving heart,
              You'll always B-Rayte there when the fun will start,
              You've never B-(t)Rayed another soul,
              or used your B-Ray gun to blast a hole.
              
              From a sense of joy we can't B-fRayn,
              Whether the sky is filled with sun or B-Rayn.
              You are often B-Raycing amongst the best in the world,
              And from your B-Rayn your knowledge of urban planning is unfurled.

              To the defense you're aB-Raysive with your lefty B-Raykes,
              Your B-raynge of throws is oft preceded by fakes,
              No B-Rayted player, you only have an A-Game,
              You'll B-Rayngin down the house with all of your fame.
              
              Even though you're sometimes ineB-Rayted at night,
              You can help people read B-Raylle if they don't have sight,
              And so as this poem ends for a B-Raydient friend,
              Stay fun and B-Reayl from the start to the end.

  bio:        "Alec has every ingredient of a leave-it-all-on-the-field, goofy, wise, and super nice, cool guy buddy.  He gets you pumped to make crazy plays on the field and to pump up your teammates like crazy on the sideline. Why? Because you better believe that whatever the stakes are and whatever the challenge of the day is, he going to show you what it looks like to be fucking AMPED to be playing the great sport of ultimate frisbee. Some say he once got stuck in the middle of a spiny roundabout on the playground and that the centripetal force caused his limbs to stretch out double in length. The truth is, however, that with every grass tickling, breakmark throw Alec grows a little longer. But you’ll miss your chance to marvel at this phenomenon, because he will have already beaten you up line with a lightning speed give-and-go. Alec is fluent in many languages including derpilyschmoop and gleebinboing (which we can only assume he learned alongside Jeff). If he isn’t busy boxing out and skying someone in the endzone, you might be lucky enough to develop a secret high-five with Alec that is good for doing pretty much anytime anywhere – sound effects always included."

              A woman once fell into the chocolate chasm of his eyes, and has not been seen since.

              His frisbee meme was so photogenic, it broke Reddit.

              He once D'd Bill Nye the Science Guy, all while explaining his own theory of relativity.

              Kittens google pictures of him when they need a pick-me-up.

              He takes magnesium for muscle cramps, and magnesium is happy to oblige.

              He's a better looking robot than you are a human.

              He always wears tights no matter the temperature, as his hamstrings are finely tuned guitar strings that must be protected.

              He does his own laundry--on his own abs.

              In the off season, he rides a black stallion named Midnight Storm.

              The next Kombucha flavor will contain droplets of his sweat.

              He can, and will, jump higher than you.

              He can, and will, lay out further than you.

              He can, and will, smile longer than you.

              His nickname may have come from nothing, but it means everything.

              He is... the most interesting ultimate player in the world.

When paired in the backfield with her buddy Alec, not only will the two of them run give-go circles around you, but they’ll do it while making goofy-as-shit noises all the while, thereby multiplying the embarrassment tenfold. Yet, despite her onfield tenacity, Georgia is also one of the nicest and coolest cats you could meet. She’s just as skilled at pumping you up as she is at helping you recognize your great worth as a person. Plus, she has a wicked haircut that, chances are, you couldn’t pull off. Ahh, screw those chances. Let’s just go with the reality: you can’t. But you are allowed to be jealous. So that’s a consolation."
